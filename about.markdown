<sup>1</sup> Some people think I am a fake Japanese. I guess this is because I have been away from Japan for too long and they have also never seen me speak Japanese. COVID-19 made it more difficult to visit Japan than before, but I intend to revisit Japan one day.

<sup>2</sup> Actual number of years lived in Singapore is greater than 20.
