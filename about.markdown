I am a Japanese<sup>1</sup> who has been living in ~~Japan~~ Singapore for over twenty years. I came to Singapore with my family when I was twelve years old. I studied Computer Science in U.S. for four years before coming back to Singapore for work.

<sup>1</sup> Some people think I am a fake Japanese. I suppose this is because I have been away from Japan for too long. COVID-19 made it more difficult to visit Japan than before, but I intend to revisit Japan one day.
